The site code is tracked via the git repository.
However, it does include a git submodule for customizations doen to the wp-stripe plugin, so you'll have to initialize that submodule manually as well, for now this is done via a manual clone.

git clone git@github.com:BitLucid/wp-stripe.git www/wp-content/plugins/wp-stripe
git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
